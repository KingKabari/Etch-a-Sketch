# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-a-Sketch is a classic drawing toy reimagined in your browser!  
Create pixel art with your mouse by hovering over a dynamic grid—change grid sizes, experiment with random colors, and watch squares darken as you "draw" over them.

## Features

- Draw by mouse: Hover over squares to color them and leave a trail.
- Randomized color: Each uncolored square gets a unique random color when first hovered.
- Progressive darkening: Every time you hover over a colored square, it gets 10% darker, reaching full opacity in 10 passes.
- Flexible grid resizing: Click the grid size button to choose up to 100 squares per side (the grid auto-resizes to fit).
- Responsive UI built with HTML, CSS Flexbox, and vanilla JavaScript.
- Clean, interactive interface inspired by the original Etch-a-Sketch.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use your mouse to hover over squares and draw pixel art.
3. Click the "Change Grid Size" button to choose your grid's dimensions (up to 100x100).
4. Each square starts blank. First hover assigns a random color; each additional hover on that square makes it 10% darker.
5. Enjoy creating art, experimenting with colors, or clearing and resizing your sketch pad as desired!
