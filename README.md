# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-a-Sketch is a classic drawing toy reimagined in your browser!  
Create pixel art with your mouse by hovering over a dynamic grid—change grid sizes, experiment with random colors, and watch squares darken as you "draw" over them.

---

## Features

- **Draw by hover:** Mouse over squares to draw (on by default).
- **Random colors:** Each uncolored square gets a unique random color when you first draw on it.
- **Progressive darkening:** Hovering repeatedly over a colored square darkens it by 10% each time (up to full color in 10 passes).
- **Black Only:** Instantly draw in bold black (like a real marker), especially effective with the light board background.
- **Eraser:** Use eraser mode to clear squares as you hover.
- **Flexible grid resizing:** Choose up to 100 squares per side with the resize button; board auto-resizes to fit.
- **Draw/Stop toggle:** Click anywhere on the board to pause or resume drawing—so you can move your cursor and use controls without accidentally drawing.
- **Status indicator:** Clearly shows whether drawing is active or paused.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with HTML, CSS Flexbox, and vanilla JavaScript.
